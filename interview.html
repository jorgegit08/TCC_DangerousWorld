          <p>When Robert Young Pelton’s The World’s Most Dangerous Places was published in 1996, there wasn’t anything like it. (“One of the oddest and most fascinating travel books to appear in a long time,” wrote The New York Times.) Now in its fifth edition, it’s a swashbuckling field guide to the world’s hot spots, laden with refreshingly frank and entertaining anecdotes from Pelton’s extensive travels—“14 wars and 130 countries,” by his count.</p>
          <p>KAMPALA: Can you crowd-fund the hunt for a war criminal on the run deep in Africa's jungles? A Canadian adventurer with experiences in Afghanistan and Somalia wants to do just that: raise funds and take a small band of former soldiers to find Joseph Kony.</p>
          <p>Robert Young Pelton, whose plan has already drawn criticism from a pair of Africa experts, is the latest to join a line of private individuals and aid groups who are trying to corner the alleged mass murderer and members of his Lord's Resistance Army.</p>
          <p>Kony remains elusive despite the deployment by President Barack Obama in late 2011 of 100 US special forces to aid the hunt, which is mostly carried out by Ugandan troops and the efforts by myriad private groups.</p>
          <p>Among those efforts: Invisible Children, an American aid group, created a web video seen by more than 100 million people last year that made Kony a family dinner topic and ''introduce new audiences to the conflict, and inspire global action.</p>
          <p>The Bridgeway Foundation, a Houston-based charity, hired a private company two years ago that specializes in military and law enforcement training to teach child hostage rescue techniques to the Ugandan troops tracking Kony.</p>
