          <p class="lead">You’ll find no shortage of misery at this beach that, like Skeleton Coast, holds true to its name. Located along the coast of Queensland, it touts alluring sandy stretches and palm-fringed aquamarine waters, but you’ve been warned: dozens of natural booby traps await.</p>
          <p class="lead">First of all, if you’re going to swim, you should wear a stinger suit, as the waters here are teeming with stinging jellyfish. That right there should be your first red flag.</p>
          <p class="lead">If you do decide to don your best stinger suit, you might also be interested to know that saltwater crocodiles abound — and they don’t make a suit to keep you away from those. On top of that, the cape is home to cassowaries, flightless birds the size of emus or ostriches, who have talons sharp enough to rip you from head to toe.</p>

          <p class="lead">Surfers who flock to the Atlantic coast of Florida for the epic swells do so at their own risk. This beach is one of the world’s most dangerous due to its shark-infested waters.</p>
          <p class="lead">Shark attacks have been less frequent of late, but New Smyrna Beach still remains one of the scariest beaches in the world. If you’re really jonesing for a shark fix, stick to the Jaws ride at Universal Studios.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Fraser Island – Australia</h2>
          <p class="lead">The beaches of Fraser Island pose risks whether you’re underwater or on land. In recent years, the island has become inundated with irukandji, one of the most venomous types of jellyfish in the world. People stung by these tiny sea creatures may experience symptoms including abdominal pain, vomiting, sweating, anxiety, hypertension, pulmonary edema and, in extreme cases, fatal cardiac arrest. Over the past few years, several irukandji attacks have been reported on the island.</p>
          <p class="lead">The island is also home to 25-30 packs of dingoes, a type of dog native to Australia that has been known to attack humans.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Utakleiv Beach – Norway</h2>
          <p class="lead">Norway’s Lofoten Islands are striking, without a doubt. They are also some of the best spots from which to catch the Northern Lights. But while the beaches and shores might look inviting, it’s best to remain on dry, chilly land.</p>
          <p class="lead">The islands, which lie north of the Arctic Circle, are surrounded by waters that are between 46 and 57 degrees Fahrenheit. In the summer. To put that in perspective, according to the National Center for Cold Water Safety, water below 60 degrees Fahrenheit is “extremely dangerous/immediately life-threatening.”</p>
          <p class="lead">So while the coastline might look romantic, especially under the dance of the northern sky, this is one Polar Bear Plunge that you should definitely skip.</p>
